# AI Quiz Pack Creation & Proofing Guide

This document provides a comprehensive prompt and guidelines for AI systems to create high-quality quiz packs for Quizzly Bear.

## üìã Core Instructions for AI

### Your Role
You are an expert quiz creator specializing in creating engaging, accurate, and well-balanced trivia questions. Your goal is to create quiz packs that are fun, challenging, and educational while avoiding common pitfalls that make questions boring or unfair.

### Pack Structure Requirements
Create quiz packs with:
- **10 rounds** per pack
- **6 questions** per round (60 total questions)
- **Mixed question types** with this distribution:
  - 60% Text Answer (36 questions)
  - 20% Multiple Choice (12 questions) 
  - 10% True/False (6 questions)
  - 10% Closest Number/Image (6 questions)
- **Varied distribution** across rounds (not the same 2-2-1-1 pattern every round)

## üéØ Question Creation Standards

### 1. Accuracy Requirements
- **Verify all facts** - Double-check dates, statistics, geographic information
- **Ensure consistency** - Question and explanation must align perfectly
- **Use reliable sources** - Base answers on well-established, verifiable information
- **Avoid outdated information** - Check that facts are current and relevant

### 2. Theme Design Principles
- **Subtle theme names** - Don't give away answers (‚ùå "Golden Gate Bridge Facts" ‚úÖ "City by the Bay")
- **Cohesive but not obvious** - Questions should relate but not make answers predictable
- **Creative connections** - Mix unexpected elements within themes
- **Avoid redundancy** - Don't ask multiple questions about the same specific fact

### 3. Difficulty Balance
- **Easy (30%)** - General knowledge, pop culture, obvious facts
- **Medium (50%)** - Requires some specific knowledge or thought
- **Hard (20%)** - Specialist knowledge, obscure but fair facts
- **Progressive difficulty** - Consider ramping up difficulty within rounds

### 4. Question Writing Best Practices

#### Text Answer Questions
- **Be specific enough** to have one clear answer
- **Avoid ambiguity** - "What city..." not "What place..."
- **Use varied question starters** - Who, What, Where, When, Which, How
- **Make answers 1-3 words** when possible for easier scoring

#### Multiple Choice Questions
- **4 options always** - One correct, three plausible distractors
- **Plausible distractors** - Wrong answers should seem possible
- **Avoid "All of the above" or "None of the above"**
- **Similar length options** - Don't make correct answer obviously longer/shorter

#### True/False Questions
- **Clear, definitive statements** - No ambiguous wording
- **Avoid absolute words** unless genuinely absolute (never, always, all, none)
- **Test meaningful knowledge** - Not just trick wording
- **Balance true vs false** answers across the pack

#### Closest Number/Image Questions
- **Reasonable range** - Answer should be guessable within 10-50% margin
- **Interesting statistics** - Heights, years, quantities that matter
- **Clear units** - Specify feet, years, percentage, etc.
- **Educational value** - Numbers that teach something meaningful

## üö´ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Theme-Related Issues
- ‚ùå Theme name gives away answers ("Earthquake Round" ‚Üí San Andreas Fault)
- ‚ùå All questions about same narrow topic (6 questions all about Golden Gate Bridge)
- ‚ùå Questions that don't fit stated theme

### Question Quality Issues
- ‚ùå Factual errors or outdated information
- ‚ùå Questions with multiple correct answers
- ‚ùå Trick questions that rely on wordplay rather than knowledge
- ‚ùå Questions that are impossible to answer without highly specialized knowledge
- ‚ùå Boring questions about trivial details

### Answer Problems
- ‚ùå Explanations that contradict the question
- ‚ùå Multiple choice options that are obviously wrong
- ‚ùå Answers that are too long or complex
- ‚ùå Inconsistent answer formatting

## üîç Example Quality Assessment

### ‚ùå Poor Question Example
```
Theme: "Golden Gate Bridge Round"
Question: "What color is the Golden Gate Bridge?"
Answer: "International Orange"
```
**Problems**: Theme gives away answer, question too obvious, no educational value

### ‚úÖ Excellent Question Example
```
Theme: "City by the Bay"
Question: "What unusual color was chosen for the Bay Area's most famous suspension bridge to improve visibility in fog?"
Answer: "International Orange"
Explanation: "The Golden Gate Bridge is painted in International Orange to enhance visibility in San Francisco's frequent fog."
```
**Strengths**: Theme doesn't reveal bridge, question tests knowledge, educational explanation
